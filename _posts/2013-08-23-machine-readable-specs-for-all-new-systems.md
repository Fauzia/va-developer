# Machine Readable Specs For All New Systems

I am reading through the executive summary for the Digits 2 Digits (D2D) project, and while this isn't a complete spec, it has a lot of spec level detail--including business requirements and system dependencies.

While reading this PDF, I can search for things, but I can't do much else. The document is very structured with title and paragraph  breaks for each section as well tables for the requirements, system dependencies and other granular level detail.

What I wouldn't give for a JSON version of this document. I will probably export to HTML and create it myself. If there was a nice JSON representation I could easily conduct better grouping, association, filtering and comparison with other D2D docs.

Imagine if every new system spec in government was machine readable by default! You could ingest it, when it was in draft form and do a discovery of other similar systems, teams and efforts across government.  Then return a machine readable list of considerations for the project team.

This would eliminate redundancy of systems, make suggestions of existing design patterns, services and other tools to that a team could make use of. I guess if I do my job, we can get closer to this vision.
