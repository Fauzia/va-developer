# My First Major PushBack At The VA

I've been riding high on the first honeymoon period of my Presidential Innovation Fellowship at the VA, but this week I hit my first individual who gave me some significant pushback on the concepts of open data and APIs in government. Of course I'm ready for a lot of this, but after being independently operating for over a year and half now, and enjoying the honeymoon period of my fellowship, it hit me pretty hard.

I was in a meeting , discussing how to get major stakeholders involved in inventorying of major IT systems and data assets, and after introducing myself some of the hard questions arose:

* These open data mandates from the White House and OMB are unfunded mandates. You are asking us to do extra work.
* Even if you are confident that your data set doesn't contain personably identifiable information (PII), because of mosaic effects where people can piece things together, you will never know if you are exposing something that will identify an individual.
* Even if the data is available in a self-service data marketplace, I can't tell a congressman to go there to get it when they ask me for it. I have to produce a PDF for them.
* There is no proof that anyone does anything with any of this data, that I've seen.

That was just a little bit of the pushback and line of questions I got from this gentleman.  These are all valid questions, and ones I have to develop a strong line of answers and evidence to challenge. I'm sure I will get this a lot in the coming here.

I would say, the strongest thing I can have, is examples of open data and APIs being put to use and saving government employees time, and the public money. Lots of work to do.
