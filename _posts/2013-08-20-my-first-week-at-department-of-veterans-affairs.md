# My First Week at Department of Veterans Affairs

I completed my first week as a Presidential Innovation Fellow at The Department of Veterans Affairs. I got my first taste of how the federal government works, and what a busy place Washington D.C. can, even in August--which is the slow time.

My week started with the general orientation that any new employee at the VA has to endure, and at the end of the week I sitll do not have an email, computer or phone, but I hear this is pretty normal process.

Even without official company equipment I spent time diving directly into my primary project, the Digits-2-Digits(D2D) program, which is focused on updating the VA claims process and evolving it into a modern web service. 

Right now the D2D program is in deep development, while the project has been in the works for over a year, it is taking some time to get the project the amount of resources, and official project status that it requires to move forward--that is what I'm here for.  

Beyond D2D I will be working to identify other data, APIs we can work on at VA, as well some other side projects you will hear about here.  

In my style I will be telling stories around all of my work, this helps me work through my thoughts, develop coherent stories to push across government and get the traction my projects will need.

Stay tuned, its going to be a wild year!
