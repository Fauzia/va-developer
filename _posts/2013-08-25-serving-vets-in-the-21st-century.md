# Serving Vets in the 21st Century

Currently the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) serves veterans through a combination of manual and online systems that strive to work together to delivery benefits, education, healthcare and other support services, from a variety of internal groups across the VA, state level organizations and partners such as Veteran Service Organizations(VSO), and County Level Veteran Service Organizations(cVSO).

The overburdened veterans benefits claims process is centered around a form-centric process which includes, but is not limited to the [21-526 form](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-526-are.pdf), and whether or not a form is implemented as paper or in a digital form, this historic form is the birth of every claims process. This form driven process is currently facilitated through a variety of public web sites, partner portals and internal systems.

All of these sites and applications are built on top of core VA databases and systems that store everything from VA facility information, benefits questionairres to personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI). These databases have evolved over the long, digital history of the VA to support the mammoth operations and applications make up the VA.

All of these support systems have been designed, developed, managed and supported from a variety of internal stakeholders, partner organizations and contractors. Which over time has resulted in a confusing mix of web, portal, mobile, database and services that can often be redundant, disparate and at odds with portions of the claims process, while supporting other aspects just fine. Much of this digital evolution works to be in support, replace or augment the physical aspects of the process, but in reality often times adds unnecessary work to the flow, making both the physical and digital aspects of the claims process very inefficient.

This mix of web, portal, mobile and physical, manual systems leaves veterans, their advocates and partner organizations struggling with understanding the best path forward to guide veterans through this often confusing process. Secondarily this mix of systems, driven by contractors can leave the VA itself challenged in defining a path forward to untangle this web of systems, and bring us into the 21st century, with a meaningful claims process that truly delivers for veterans and their families as expected.

There is a single, new initiative at the VA, with the potential to provide a blueprint for redefining systems, access to databases, while also applying business rules and submitting forms, in a way that doesn't just address internal needs, but provides access for partner organizations to help carry the load on behalf of the veterans.  This new approach is using a web service, that is currently called Digits 2 Digits (D2D).  Web services in itself is not an new concept, there are numerous web services in operation at the VA, but this new approach acknowledges the importance of empowering VA partners, while also driving internal systems through a central common services approach, and coherent governance strategy for design, deployment, operations, sustainment and security.

Web services are not new, but this new approach to using them in a way that provides access to internal resources, extending interaction to trusted partners and in some cases secure access to public organizations and individuals, has already ben proven in the private sector. Leading companies in the tech sector like Amazon Web Services and Netflix have adopted service driven operating models, and even non-commercial entities like NPR are proving this new approach to be central to growth and supporting their constituents. These same principles are also being evangelized by the White House Office of Science and Technology(OSTP) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Web services start with clear definition of individual resources or even complete set of resources, that can be specified and developed once, maintained centrally, then used in many places within the VA and across partner organizations systems. Web services can provide this granular level access to data and resources, in a very secure manner giving only the data and resources to systems, organizations and individuals who are granted appropriate access.  

Currently Digits 2 Digits (D2D) provides the ability to submit and manage the 21-526 form, that is required for starting and maintaining a claim. D2D understands the wide variety of internal systems it needs to talk to when submitting and accessing claim information, as well as the business rules that are associated with the claims process. This approach can be extended to all VA forms, data, resources or wrap entire processes--establishing a common services architecture for  VA that is in alignment with current enterprise approaches.

Using D2D as a blueprint, the VA can establish a common platform where all web services can be hung, creating a library of modular web services that are designed to accomplish specific goals that are in alignment with the claims process. The VA service commons will employ a universal approach to governance where services are designed, deployed, managed, accessed, sustained in a standardized, secure way. Governance is about maintaining the best quality library of reusable, modular services, that can be used across the VA, as well as partner systems, with increased efficiency while also eliminating redundancy. Before any new work is being planned for any systems, the service commons is visited to ensure a service doesn't already exist--increasing agility while also saving money.

The VA services commons will provide a suite of valuable resources to drive the next generation of applications, providing a smorgasbord of decoupled resources that are language agnostic, but also platform independent. This services approach allows for integration of common services across web sites, web and mobile applications across the VA and its partners without redundancy. Services are already feeding healthy digital strategies from social, cloud to mobile across the private sector, providing a common pattern to scale, distribute and provide access to valuable resources and data, that is secure and in real-time.

Web services do not just provide granular resource and data access to drive new applications, they can bridge legacy resources and databases in a way that allow them to be defined, wrapped and delivered in a modern, centralized way. These wrappers provide a single point of access to resources, and once all legacy applications have migrated to use new services or upgraded to newer versions, legacy systems can then be systematically retired, shifting sustainment money to much needed, newer applications.

A services commons, healthy governance, and central service blueprint are not just a technical solution to untangling the myriad of current systems at the VA. Services provide a central resource repository for VA projects, contractors, but most importantly extend resources and access to VA partners. Our work cannot be done without these partners--VSOs, cVSOs, state organizations and other advocates for veterans and their families need to be equipped with the best possible technology as possible. A services approach will equip the VA to build the next generation of applications, retire legacy systems, securely extend the tools and services trusted partners will need to facilitate the claims process, while providing multi-channel access delivering on the next generation of mobile, tablet and online tools--piece by piece, resource by resource bringing the VA towards a 21st century delivery model which our veterans deserve.
